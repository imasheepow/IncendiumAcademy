Chemistry is all about atoms, molecules, and their interactions. In this lesson, we will be quantifying some of these interactions, specifically in regards to organic chemistry. 

## Introduction

Reactions are the result of the movement of electrons. In inorganic chemistry, you may have seen this occur during the formation of an ionic compound. For example, in the formation of calcium oxide:![CaO](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/655433154978381864/802753866453876784/CaO_noarrow.png)

In this case, two electrons are completely transferred from calcium to oxygen (ignore the fact that oxygen wouldn't occur as a single atom for now). In chemistry, we represent these interactions in more detail using something known as **arrow pushing notation**.

In this case, this electron transfer is represented using a arrow from calcium to oxygen:![CaO](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/655433154978381864/802753864422916106/CaO.png)	

The notation is very easy to understand: simply draw an arrow from the electron source to the electron destination. In this case, the electron source is calcium, and the electron destination is oxygen. The arrow-head represents the number of electrons transferred. A double arrowhead represents 2 electrons, and a single arrowhead represents 1 electron. We will also introduce some notation here: **nucleophiles** are the electron sources, and **electrophiles** are electron destinations. If you've done Lewis acids and bases before, then you've also seen these as Lewis bases and Lewis acids, respectively.

In organic chemistry, the electronegativity difference between atoms is generally too small for ionic bonding. This means electrons are shared in a bond, rather than given. 

This gives us 3 main sources (atoms, sigma bonds, pi bonds) and 2 main destinations (atoms, sigma bonds) for electron pairs (we will discuss one electron transfers in a later lesson), which gives us 6 main interactions. 

We will go through each of these interactions briefly.

#### Atom to Atom

In this interaction, an electron pair is transferred from one atom to another to create a sigma bond between them. There are 2 main ways chemists designate this interaction:

- Draw an arrow directly from the electron donating atom to the electron accepting atom

- Draw an arrow from the electron donating atom to the midpoint of the two atoms to emphasize the formation of a bond

Both are used in modern chemistry, but for the purposes of this lesson we will be drawing arrows directly between atoms.

#### Atom to Sigma

In this interaction, an electron pair is transferred from the electron donor to the sigma bond between the electron donor and electron acceptor to form a pi bond.

#### Sigma to Atom

In this interaction, an electron pair originally used in a sigma bond is transferred to one of the atoms in the bond.

We can also transfer the electrons to an atom outside of the bond, in which case it forms a sigma bond between the electron donating atom to the electron accepting atom.

#### Sigma to Sigma

In this interaction, an electron pair originally used in a sigma bond is transferred to another sigma bond to create a pi bond, breaking the old sigma bond in the process.

#### Pi to Atom

In this interaction, an electron pair originally used in a pi bond is transferred to one of the atoms in the bond.

We can also transfer the pi electrons to an atom outside of the bond, in which case it forms a sigma bond between the electron donating atom to the electron accepting atom.

#### Pi to Sigma

In this interaction, an electron pair originally used in a pi bond is transferred to a sigma bond to create another pi bond.

## Predicting Electron Movement

### Forming Bonds

Imagine a box filled with a high pressure of air, and a box filled with a low pressure of air. When you connect the two boxes, it is obvious that air will move from the high pressure box to the low pressure box. The same principle applies for electrons. In this case, electron "pressure" is more formally known as **electron density**. Atoms or molecules with high electron density are more likely to donate electrons, making them good nucleophiles or **nucleophilic**. Similarly, atoms and molecules with low electron density are more likely to accept electrons, making them good electrophiles or **electrophilic**. 

3 main factors affect the electron density of an atom:

#### Electron Configuration

If an atom has less electrons in its valence energy level than an another atom with the same valence energy level it will have a lower electron density, and vice versa. This is because the radius and therefore "volume" of an atom is based on the valence energy level, and so when that volume does not change, density becomes directly proportional to the number of electrons. 

For similar reasons, density will generally decrease as the valence energy level goes up, and vice versa.

#### Neighboring Atoms

If an atom is bonded to atoms of higher electronegativity, its electron density will be decreased, and vice versa. This is because shared electrons will be around more electronegative atoms more often.

#### Charge

If an atom has a negative charge, it will have more electrons and therefore have a higher electron density, and vice versa.

Using this knowledge, we can predict how some basic interactions will occur. For example, when these two species interact,

We know that the hydroxide oxygen will be the nucleophile. This is because the hydroxide oxygen has a high electron density: it has a negative charge, is on the right side of the periodic table, and has more electropositive atoms bonded to it.

We also know that the positively charge carbon will be the electrophile: it has a positive charge, and is more to the left than oxygen is on the periodic table.

Therefore, we can predict that electrons will move from the hydroxide oxygen to the positively charged carbon.

### Breaking Bonds

When breaking bonds, we follow a different set of rules. Instead of utilizing electron density, we utilize electronegativity. In a covalent bond, electrons are shared, but not necessarily equally. Shared electrons will spend the majority of their time in the more electronegative atom. So when a bond breaks, the electrons will tend to prefer moving to the more electronegative atom. We can think about this as a matter of "convenience"; the electrons are already mostly there, so it isn't that big of a deal to just remain permanently there. We can also think of the more electronegative atom as attracting the electrons more strongly. 

Utilizing this rule, we can predict the result when a bond breaks. For example, for the following compound:

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/655433154978381864/802754028571852840/Predict2.png" alt="Predict2" style="zoom:50%;" />

If we break the covalent bond, the electrons will prefer moving to the chlorine as it is more electronegative. Therefore, the result will be:
